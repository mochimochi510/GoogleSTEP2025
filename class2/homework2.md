## The reason why tree structures are used instead of hash tables

* the worst time calculation quantity of tree structures is O(logN), while the worst time calculation quantity of hash tables is O(N).
Therefore, tree structures is better in case of the worst senario.

* hash tables may cause hash colision, but not tree struction.
